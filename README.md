# bash_timelapse

This is a collection of scripts that are very specific to my timelapse setup, specifically around a hikvision camera I have.
A lot of it assumes files named as such:

2020_11_29-2020_11_29/192.168.1.91_01_202011129114317976_TIMING.jpg

i.e. dated folder, and ip+timestamped jpg snaps.
